                    <p>Judo, or the Way of Gentleness, an ideal form of physical exercise and a reliable system of self-defense, was specially created from traditional Japanese martial arts. Over a hundred years ago Jigoro Kano mastered swordsmanship and hand-to-hand combat. Failing to discover any underlying principle, he set about designing a new martial are to reflect the concept of maximum efficiency in the use of physical and mental energy. Today, the concepts and techniques of judo taught at our Kodokan are the ones originally devised by the master himself.</p>

          <!-- <h2>Sensei Eddie DeGaetano</h2> -->
          <p>Sensei Eddie DeGaetano is a retired NYC Firefighter, who is also currently self employed for more than 20 years in NYC as a successful construction company owner. Hard work, honesty, and determination have always been his motto. Growing up as the youngest in a family of five, things were, to say the least, very challenging. Through many years of hard work for other construction companies, he decided it was time to start his own. So in 1991, he opened his own construction company and has never looked back. He started his martial arts training career back in 1993 at The House Of Karate, SI, NY http://thehouseofkarate.com under Sensei George Smith also known as Sensei Smitty to most. He has been teaching Okinawa Goju Ryu Karate at the same location for more than 40 years. Sensei Smitty was born into a family of fighters, his grandfather being a bare knuckle boxer. Sensei DeGaetano once again, with hard work, determination, and a no quit attitude, worked his way up the ranks to receive his rank of Yondan Renshi. He started instructing classes at The House of Karate for Sensei Smith back in 1997. In 1998, he wanted to further his training. So with several other black belts from the House Of Karate, he went to Okinawa Japan to train at the Jundokan http://www.jundokan-hb.com under Eiichi Miyazato. Eiichi Miyazato, a direct descendent of Chojun Miyagi, who was the founder of Okinawan Goju Ryu had a positive influence on him. The energy, hard core training, and tradition left a lifetime impression on him. In 2000, Sensei wanted to further his training yet again, this time trying another Martial Arts that he thought would compliment his many years of training in Goju Ryu. That is when he met Sensei John Bassano of NY Dojo http://www.nydojo.org/. An “Old School” no nonsense type of a guy, who has been teaching traditional Judo also for more than 40 years. Sensei DeGaetano discovered another Martial Art that he loved, especially because of how well it worked with the Goju Ryu Karate style. After many years of wanting to teach, he decided it was time to open his own Dojo. In 2012, he found a location in Colts Neck, NJ where he lives with his wife and two young children. Sensei knows the importance and benefits of learning the Martial Arts for children and adults. Martial Arts will help prepare them mentally, as well as physically for the challenges they face today in this complex world. Today, Sensei DeGaetano still continues to train in both styles under Sensei Smith, and Sensei Bassano.
